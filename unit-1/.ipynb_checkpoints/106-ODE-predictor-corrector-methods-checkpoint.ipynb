    "## Runge Kutta Methods\n",

    "**Runge Kutta** (RK) methods are one of the most widely used methods for solving ODEs. Recall that the Euler method uses the first two terms in Taylor series to approximate the numerical integration, which is linear:\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to get this more accurate solution, we need to derive the expressions of $S''(t_j), S'''(t_j), \\cdots, S^{(n)}(t_j)$. This extra work can be avoided using the RK methods, which are based on truncated Taylor series, but do not require computation of these higher derivatives. \n",

    "### Second order Runge Kutta method\n",
